###Aboreal
2D Platformer written for the [Godot Wild Jam #38](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-38)

**Theme**: Solarpunk

Outcome: Unfortunately, I was unable to finish the game in time. All the work is available though and I can use some of these assets in future projects.

Developed on the [Godot Game Engine (v3.3.2)](https://godotengine.org/)
